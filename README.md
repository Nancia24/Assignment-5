construction of classes in Java 

The Fynbos Flower company is flexible on the hours that employees work, and as a consequence, 
timekeeping is an important administrative practice. The company records the dates and times of 
shifts (for want of a better word). Employees sign-in when they arrive and sign-out when they 
leave. The start of a shift and the end of a shift always fall within the same week.
This information supports a range of enquiries
o whether an employee is present,
o whether an employee was present on a given day,
o the details of the shift worked on a given day,
o the total hours worked during a given week.
o the shifts worked during a given week.
Though, currently, none of the employees bear the same name, the company assigns each a 
unique ID number that may be used to disambiguate.
The concept of a "week" bears elaboration. A business week starts on a Monday and ends on a 
Sunday. The weeks are numbered. The first week of the year is the one that contains the first 
Thursday of the year.
In the appendix you will find a set of specifications for an Employee class and classes that it depends 
on: Shift, Week, CalendarTime, Date, Time, Duration and TimeUni
